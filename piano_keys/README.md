# piano-keys

## Overview

This set of scripts actuates piano keys and components from midi file data

## Getting Started

The scripts build ontop of each other in the following order:

1. generate_keys.py
2. actuate_keys_by_midi.py
3. rename_components.py
4. lower_all_hammers.py
5. actuate_piano_by_midi.py

Scripts 1 and 2 can be used on their own where scripts 3 to 5 utilized a
pre-made asset from blender market but could be modified to work with a
different blender asset.
